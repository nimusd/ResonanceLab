a desktop application for your personal use that will:

Support arbitrary tuning systems, potentially based on the Scala format
Output .wav audio files
Provide total control over the generation process using additive synthesis
Allow customization of not just musical elements (scales, chords, melodies) but also the instruments themselves
Be developed as a C# .NET WinForms application using NAudio and NWave libraries

This sounds like a sophisticated music generation system that goes beyond conventional equal temperament constraints, giving you complete control over the harmonic structure of your compositions.
Let's start breaking down the core requirements in more detail:

Tuning System Module:

Parser for Scala (.scl) files to import tuning definitions
Capability to define custom tuning systems
Frequency calculation engine for arbitrary scales
ResonanceLab

(AKA Intonality, intonation/tonality dualityonan)

Sound Synthesis:

Additive synthesis engine
Custom instrument definition interface
Harmonic control parameters


Composition Engine:

Chord progression generator using non-equal temperament
Melody generator that follows the selected tuning system
Harmony rules that can adapt to different tuning systems


Audio Output:

.wav file generation using NAudio/NWave
Appropriate sampling rate and bit depth options


User Interface:

Controls for selecting/defining tuning systems
Instrument design interface
Composition parameter controls
